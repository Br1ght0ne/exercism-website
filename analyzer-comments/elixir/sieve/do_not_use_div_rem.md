# do not use `div`/`rem`

Sieve algorithm should mark multiples of a prime number as composite.
While `div` and `rem` can be used to check for this, try to find these numbers by multiplying your prime.
[`Enum.chunk_every/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html#chunk_every/2)  might be useful to partition your sieve.
